    <p>
    The advisor had the following compensation scheme:   
    </p>
    <p>
    If the estimator's estimate exceeded the number of solid dots in the grid (i.e., if the estimator's estimate was 410 or above), <strong>the advisor earned {{ Constants.advisor_bonus }}</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
    If the estimator's estimate exceeded the number of solid dots in the grid by 100 or more (i.e., if the estimator's estimate was 509 or above), <strong>the advisor earned {{ Constants.advisor_big_bonus }}</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>The estimator earned {{ Constants.estimator_bonus }}</strong> if their estimate was within 10 dots of the correct answer (in this case, between 399 and 419).
