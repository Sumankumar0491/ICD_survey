    Now weâ€™d like to tell you more information about your advisor. Your advisor had access to the entire 30x30 grid 
    and knew the exact number of shaded-in cells, which was <strong>{{ group.correct_answer }}</strong>. 
    </p>
    <p>
    The picture the advisor saw is below:
    </p>

    <td valign="middle" align="center">
        <img src="{% static "" %}{{ group.grid_path }}" width="100%" vspace="20"/>
    </td>

    {% if group.disclosure == True %}
	<p>
	<strong>As specified earlier, your advisor was NOT compensated if you were accurate</strong>, but if you 
	<strong>overestimated</strong> the true number of solid dots. Your advisor had the following compensation 
	scheme:
	</p>
    {% else %}
	<p>
	<strong>Your advisor was compensated NOT if you were accurate</strong>, but if you 
	<strong>overestimated</strong> the true number of solid dots. Your advisor had the following compensation 
	scheme:
    {% endif %}

	<p>
	If your estimate exceeded the number of solid dots in the grid, <strong>the advisor earned a 
	{{ Constants.advisor_bonus }} bonus</strong>.
	</p> 
	<p>
	If your estimate exceeded the number of solid dots in the grid by <em>100 or more</em>, <strong>the 
	advisor earned a {{ Constants.advisor_big_bonus }} bonus</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
	<strong><em>
	Thus, your advisor could earn extra money if you overestimated the number of solid dots.
	</strong></em>
