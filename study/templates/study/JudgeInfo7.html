    Recall that the dots-estimation task had the following compensation scheme:
    </p>

    <table style="width:100%" margin="20px">
	    <tr>
		    <td>If the estimator guessed...</td>
		    <td>the estimator was paid...</td>
		    <td>the advisor was paid...</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		    <th>Less than {{ row2_lower }}</th>
		    <td>Nothing</td>
		    <td>Nothing</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		    <th>{{ row2_lower }}-{{ row2_upper }}</th>
		    <td>{{ Constants.estimator_bonus }}</td>
		    <td>Nothing</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		    <th>{{ row3_lower }}-{{ row3_upper }}</th>
		    <td>{{ Constants.estimator_bonus }}</td>
		    <td>{{ Constants.advisor_bonus }}</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		    <th>{{ row4_lower }}-{{ row4_upper }}</th>
		    <td>Nothing</td>
		    <td>{{ Constants.advisor_bonus }}</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
		    <th>Greater than {{ row4_upper }}</th>
		    <td>Nothing</td>
		    <td>{{ Constants.advisor_big_bonus }}</td>
	    </tr>
    </table><br/>



    <p>
    Recall that the advisor told the estimator there were <strong>{{ group.recommendation }}</strong> solid dots and the estimator was {% if group.disclosure == False %}<strong>not</strong>{% endif %} informed that the advisor stood to benefit financially if she overestimated. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Recall also that the estimator estimated there were <strong>{{ group.estimate }}</strong>. As a result, the advisor earned a bonus of {{ advisor_reward }} and the estimator earned a bonus of {{ estimator_reward }}.
    </p>
    <p>
    On the next page, you will be asked to make a judgement about whether the estimator was treated fairly.
