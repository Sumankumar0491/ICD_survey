    The advisorâ€™s message included a disclosure notice about his compensation scheme, which the advisee was able to view before making the ultimate estimate.

    The disclosure let the advisee know that the advisor was not compensated based on the accuracy of the advisee's estimate, but was paid if the advisee overestimated the true number of solid dots.
